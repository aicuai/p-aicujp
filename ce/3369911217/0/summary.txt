The fix was converting all function-based config (`deriveFrom`, `deriveAnswers`) to **declarative, serializable** formats:
- `deriveFrom: (a) => a` → `derive: "copy"`
- `deriveFrom: (a) => a[0]` → `derive: "first"`
- `deriveFrom: (a) => includes check` → `derive: { ifIncludes: "label", value: "val" }`
- `deriveAnswers: (answers) => ...` → `mergedQuestions: [{ questionId, splits }]`

The resolution logic (`resolveDerive`) now lives in `LiquidGlassForm.jsx` (client-side), keeping the config purely data.
