Build passes cleanly. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

**New file: `src/lib/survey-commentary.ts`**
- `getQuestionCommentary()` — main function for single-question commentary (25 question templates)
- `getPairedBarCommentary()` — paired-bar gap analysis commentary (done vs want)
- `getPyramidCommentary()` — population pyramid cross-tabulation commentary
- Helpers: `topN()`, `entropyLevel()`, `responseRateNote()`, `listTop()`
- Each template generates 2-3 sentences: context (static) + data insight (dynamic) + PI perspective (conditional)

**Modified: `src/app/q/R2602/results/ResultsClient.tsx`**
- Imported commentary functions + `computeGapAnalysis`
- Added `Commentary` component (grey background, teal left border, 12px font)
- Integrated commentary into all 4 card types: single, paired-bar, age-pie, pyramid
- Commentary displays between chart and `StatsFooter`
